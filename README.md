# Sprint 5 â€“ React Native app

Todays assignment is to set up a mobile app that displays a page and
a main menu. The page should display functionality that uses the sensors
of a mobile phone. For instance: camera, gyro, accelerometer, etc.

## How to complete this assignment

* Download the Expo app on your phone and then read the expo guide at https://expo.io/learn to start a React Native project with Expo.

* Read the React Navigation guide at https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/hello-react-navigation.html to set up
navigation between pages in your app.

* Discover React components created by Expo at https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/
and add them to your pages. Scroll down the menu on the left of the page and look for
SDK API REFERENCE. There you will see all the components.

* Recommended components (Look at the examples of how to use them):
- [Camera](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v31.0.0/sdk/camera)
- [Accelerometer](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v31.0.0/sdk/accelerometer)
- [Gyroscope](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v31.0.0/sdk/gyroscope)



### Project setup

You will use the expo-cli in the terminal to generate your project code.

### :sos: How to get help
Learning how to think as a web developer is learning how to be an expert in problem solving. So whenever you get stuck start with step 1 and continue until problem solved.

1. Google! In English, type in the error message if there is one, search within the language you're using (ie CSS, JavaScript etc).
2. Ask your code buddies in your team.
3. Ask your fellow students in Slack.
4. Ask the teacher. Please note: we are part of a sharing community - share the answer with your fellows.

### :boom: Success!

After completing this assignment you should know how to set up a React Native
project with Expo and be comfortable using React Navigation. You should also
be able to use components from Expo.

### :runner: Stretch Goals

#### First stretch goal
Add one more page which displays another component from Expo.


#### Second stretch goal
Use tab-navigation to navigate between your pages. Use the expo-cli in terminal
to generate a new project with the tabs-template to look at a working example
of tab-navigation.
